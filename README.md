# Introduction
The main focus of this project is the game’s cart system. I decided to create this, after playing `Red Dead Redemption 2`, being more specific, because of the game’s general stores system that uses a 'book' to buy items in-game.

# How to use
Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/vinicius-goncalves/vintage-shopping.git` and then, start using the Live Server plugin for VS Code, and then access the `index.html` file, or just open the `index.html` file directly.

# Try it out
