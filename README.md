# Introduction
The main focus of this project is the inspiration in a game’s cart system, and the project's cart system itself. I decided to create this, after playing `Red Dead Redemption 2`, being more specific, because of the game’s general stores system that uses a 'book' to buy items in-game.

It's just a cart system, with product prices being generated randomly on the home page. Once adding a product is added the cart, that price becomes the 'final price', unless the product is removed later and added again with the currenct price at that moment.
